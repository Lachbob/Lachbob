- 🌱 I’m currently learning at Capilano University, just finished my first year, and I'm looking to practice and hone my current skill set!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and all things regarding VFX, whether it be 2D title sequences, 3D layout/modeling, Roto work, or Image editing, I would like to help!
